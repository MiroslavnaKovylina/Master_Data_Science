# Assignment Overview

This repository contains four distinct machine learning tasks covering data analysis, prediction, and deep learning models. Below is a brief description of each task:

## 1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Data
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and distributions.
- Generate visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

## 2. Customer Churn Prediction
- Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data.
- Perform feature engineering and selection to optimize model performance.
- Compare different classification models and evaluate their accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 3. Time Series Forecasting
- Apply time series analysis techniques to predict future values.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE.

## 4. Image Classification on CIFAR-10 with Neural Networks
- Train a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Optimize the model through data augmentation, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning.
